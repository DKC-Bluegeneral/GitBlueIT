From the OOBE Screen press Shift + F10
```
curl -L -o skip.cmd https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DKC-Bluegeneral/GitBlueIT/main/skip.cmd
skip.cmd
```

This will skip the entire OOBE process including microsoft account and ANY questions during the setup process. It still allows you to select your language, region, and keyboard layout.
